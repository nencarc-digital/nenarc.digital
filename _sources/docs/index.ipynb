    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will cover how to create your own book using this template. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a GitHub account setup for this process (if not using the nencarc.digital@gmail.com account) which can be done by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/join).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  install the relevant packages required for github\n",

    "### Editing Page Content \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to being able to edit any page content, the installation of a source-code editor is required. There are a number of available options, with my personal preference being Visual Studio code which can be found at this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options include [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) and [Sumblime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of convenience, the tutorial will utilise the editor, Visual Studio Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening And Explaining Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to open the repository folder in your editor of choice. This example is in Visual Studio Code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/index/screenshot37.png\n",
    ":scale: 35%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the folder of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/index/screenshot38.png\n",
    ":scale: 35%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a general guide of what the important aspects of the folder structure are. \n",

    ":scale: 50%\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Editing Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated above, the pages are contained in the 'docs' folder. There are various types of content that can included on each page. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### General Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generally, unlike in HTML, does not require any special tags for the programming language markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings are annotated using the '#' symbol. The less '#' symbols used, the higher the hierarchy of heading. For example, the heading for the entire page would typically use '#', however any subheading after that would require at the very minimum '##'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any subsection as part of the '##' subsection, they would require an additional symbol, which would result in '###', and so on and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperlinks \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperlinks are simple to implement, as they involve square brackets around the word desired to be clickable, and parentheses containing the link. The code below demonstrates this."
