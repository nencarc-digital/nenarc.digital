    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will cover how to create your own book using this template. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a GitHub account setup for this process (if not using the nencarc.digital@gmail.com account) which can be done by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/join).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  install the relevant packages required for github\n",
    "2.  setup a new github repository and github page\n",
    "3.  add/edit/delete content from the book \n",
    "4.  push the content to the github repository and live github page \n",

    "#### Windows Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Anaconda Installation\n",

    "Although the use of Git is possible without any python installation, the use of a python environment manager ensures the process is a lot simpler and more convenient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, on a Windows machine the installation of Anaconda is required. The link to the download page can be found [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Windows-x86_64.exe). \n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation process, this option will appear. Choose the 'Register' option.\n",

    "\n",
    "As demonstrated above, the pages are contained in the 'docs' folder. There are various types of content that can included on each page. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### General Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generally, unlike in HTML, does not require any special tags for the programming language markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings are annotated using the '#' symbol. The less '#' symbols used, the higher the hierarchy of heading. For example, the heading for the entire page would typically use '#', however any subheading after that would require at the very minimum '##'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any subsection as part of the '##' subsection, they would require an additional symbol, which would result in '###', and so on and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperlinks \n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperlinks are simple to implement, as they involve square brackets around the word desired to be clickable, and parentheses containing the link. The code below demonstrates this."
