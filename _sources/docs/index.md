## Overview

This section will cover how to create your own book using this template.

You will learn how to

1.  install the relevant packages required for github
2.  setup a new github repository and github page
3.  add/edit/delete content from the book 
4.  push the content to the github repository and live github page 

### Packages Needed

To begin, git needs to be install on your system. Depending if you are on a Windows device or MAC OS device, there are different installation methods to use. 

For windows, the following [link](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.37.3.windows.1/Git-2.37.3-32-bit.exe) will lead you to the installation package. 

For MAC OS, I would recommend the use of Homebrew for the installation, which can be installed via entering the following code into terminal.

```{code-cell} ipython3
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, git can then be installed via the following command.

```{code-cell} ipython3
brew install git.
```

### Setting Up New Page

#### Downloading Template

Download the template zip file from GitHub using this [link](https://github.com/nencarc-digital/template/raw/main/book/_static/lecture_specific/index/template.zip). Unzip the file and then export the folder to a desired location and save the folder name.

#### Creating New Repository

Then proceed to click on 'Main'. This source will change to 'gh-pages' at a later date but for now but 'Main' is the only option.
